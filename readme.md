Welcome to Rational Evaluator Application

This document describes the Rational Evaluator Application

There are three inter-dependent files, namely:
1) Rational.h : it is the header file which contains two class definitions - Rational and Expression; it also defines the class methods
2) ratUser.cpp : it contains the main function and is implemented on the user side
3) TestCases.txt : it is an editable document containing valid expressions line by line

There is another file, namely:
1) ratEval.exe : it is the executable file after compiling

** Note: It is important to keep the four dependent files in the smae folder we compiling. If you would like to test some expressions (expressions are assumed to be valid) you can either add them in the TestCases.txt file or test them during the execution of the main program. You will get an option for both the cases.

** Note: A slight problem - the executable runs into a segmentation fault error when running test cases on the linux server. It works completely fine offline, on windows. It also runs into an unexpected error when multiple calls to functions are made while the application is running.

All and every piece of code in this folder is part of a comprehensive assignment given in the course FM121: Programming and Data Structures offered to First Year B.Tech students at Plaksha University.

These are intellectual properties of Arnab Dey (UG20210014) of Plaksha University (batch of 2025). Any attempt made to copy, reporduce, transmit, or damage the code will have subsequent repercussions.
